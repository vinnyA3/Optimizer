### Overview

Optimizer provides C++ solutions to optimization problems.  The goal is to build an Optimization library for C++ which can provide solutions for single variable and multi-variable optimization, constrained and unconstrained problems. The users should be able to select the algorithm to be used and also access any intermediate data which is obtained whilst running the algorithm.

### A simple first program

```
int main () {
  double min = 5.3;
  cout << min << endl;
}
```
